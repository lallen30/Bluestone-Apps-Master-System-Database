# Application Pages Implementation Status

## Completed âœ…

### Database
- âœ… Created `screens` table in schema.sql
- âœ… Added proper indexes and foreign keys

### Backend API
- âœ… Created `screenController.js` with full CRUD operations
- âœ… Created `screenRoutes.js` with permission-based middleware
- âœ… Registered routes in `server.js`
- âœ… Added screens API to frontend `api.ts`

### Frontend Components
- âœ… Created `AppLayout.tsx` with left sidebar navigation
- âœ… Created Dashboard page at `/app/[id]/page.tsx`

## In Progress ðŸš§

### Frontend Pages (Need to create)
- ðŸš§ Users page at `/app/[id]/users/page.tsx`
- ðŸš§ Screens page at `/app/[id]/screens/page.tsx`
- ðŸš§ Settings page at `/app/[id]/settings/page.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. Create Users page with add/edit functionality (similar to master/users)
2. Create Screens placeholder page ("Coming Soon")
3. Create Settings placeholder page ("Coming Soon")
4. Test permission checks
5. Restart Docker containers to apply database changes

## API Endpoints Created

- `GET /api/v1/screens/app/:app_id` - Get all screens for an app
- `GET /api/v1/screens/:id` - Get screen by ID
- `POST /api/v1/screens` - Create screen (requires edit permission)
- `PUT /api/v1/screens/:id` - Update screen (requires edit permission)
- `DELETE /api/v1/screens/:id` - Delete screen (requires delete permission)

## Permission Checks

All app pages check:
- User must be authenticated
- User must have permissions for the specific app
- Specific actions require specific permissions (edit, delete, manage_users, manage_settings)
