# User Dashboard Implementation

## Changes Made

### Fixed User Login Flow
Previously, non-master admin users were redirected to `/dashboard` after login, but the dashboard wasn't properly configured to show their assigned apps.

### Updated Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
**File:** `admin_portal/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Fetch User's Assigned Apps Only**
   - Now uses `permissionsAPI.getUserPermissions(user.id)` instead of `appsAPI.getAll()`
   - Only shows apps the user has explicit permissions for
   - Master admins are automatically redirected to `/master`

2. **App Cards Grid**
   - Displays apps as clickable cards in a responsive grid
   - Each card shows:
     - App name and domain
     - Permission badges (View, Edit, Delete, Users, Settings)
     - Gradient icon
     - Hover effects
   - Clicking a card navigates to `/app/{app_id}` dashboard

3. **Empty State**
   - Shows friendly message when user has no app access
   - Prompts user to contact administrator

## User Flow

### For Regular Users (Non-Master Admin):
1. **Login** → User enters credentials at `/login`
2. **Dashboard** → Redirected to `/dashboard` showing their assigned apps
3. **Select App** → Click on an app card
4. **App Dashboard** → Navigate to `/app/{id}` with full sidebar navigation

### For Master Admins:
1. **Login** → User enters credentials at `/login`
2. **Master Dashboard** → Redirected to `/master` with full admin controls
3. **Can access any app** → No explicit permissions needed

## Testing Steps

### 1. Create a Test User
```sql
-- Login to phpMyAdmin at http://localhost:8080
-- Run this SQL:

-- Create a test user (password: test123)
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, role_id, is_active)
VALUES ('testuser@example.com', '$2a$10$rZ8qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ9qKqZ', 'Test', 'User', 3, 1);

-- Get the user ID (should be the last inserted ID)
SET @user_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Assign user to an app (replace 1 with actual app_id)
INSERT INTO user_app_permissions (user_id, app_id, can_view, can_edit, can_manage_users)
VALUES (@user_id, 1, 1, 1, 1);
```

### 2. Test Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/login
2. Login with:
   - Email: `testuser@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard`
4. Should see app cards for assigned apps only

### 3. Test App Access
1. Click on an app card
2. Should navigate to `/app/{id}` dashboard
3. Should see sidebar with Dashboard, Users, Screens, Settings
4. Should be able to navigate between pages based on permissions

## Password Hash for Testing

For password `test123`:
```
$2a$10$YourHashHere
```

To generate a new hash, you can use the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "test123",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "role_id": 3
  }'
```

## Features

✅ **User Dashboard**
- Shows only apps user has access to
- Displays permission badges
- Clickable cards navigate to app dashboard
- Responsive grid layout
- Empty state for users with no apps

✅ **Permission-Based Access**
- Users can only see apps they're assigned to
- Master admins see all apps
- App pages check permissions before allowing access

✅ **Consistent Navigation**
- All app pages use AppLayout with sidebar
- Back to dashboard/master button
- Logout functionality

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/v1/permissions/user/:user_id` - Get user's app permissions
- `GET /api/v1/apps/:id` - Get app details

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual users
2. Add more granular permission checks
3. Consider adding user profile page
4. Add activity logs to dashboard
5. Add quick stats to dashboard
